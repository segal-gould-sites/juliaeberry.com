## Welcome to Julia Berry's website.
It exists in celebration of her [21st birthday](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=January+12th,+1996).

Julia is a talented writer and studies literature at [Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York](http://www.bard.edu/). She is among the kindest and most intelligent people I know, and these qualities will take her to new heights as she pursues her goals in the days and years to come. I've created this site to showcase her extensive [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/juliaeberry/) portfolio, but by no means must it serve exclusively that singular purpose. 

Julia, I love you and nothing brings me more joy than to see you living a fulfilling life in which you accomplish all you set out to do. I don't have to expect greatness from you, because you've already shown the power you have to obtain it wherever you go. Happy birthday, Julia. In the years to come, I'm sure I'll lose count of the ways you impress me.

Thank you for being one of my closest friends. This world has much to offer you. All you have to do is make it your own.

Never stop being the joy you are,
[Noah Segal-Gould](http://segal-gould.com/)
